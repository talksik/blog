## Not seeing things
As we get older, time goes by quicker because we try to understand the world by patterns and categories. When going on a walk, we don't look at a tree the same way we did when we were younger.

Thus, over time, we stop seeing things. We stop seeing the tree, and we start seeing the category of tree. We stop seeing the person, and we start seeing the category of person. 

_This is also why we continue living with invisible constructs._ Whether there is a problem with the way we live today is irrelevant; however, the seers & builders are able to build the new world. See [this post]({% post_url 2024-03-21-everything-is-made-by-people %}) for more on this.

## Why meetings?
I am unsure when and how meetings were created, but it was not considered an innovation. It is more like the only method of getting a group of people together to discuss something.

The thing is, _we all hate meetings._ There are articles on zoom fatigue, calendar burnout, and companies limiting meetings. We've just *learned to live with it.* 

This entire post is just one example of a construct we have lived with.

### Meetings are timed
I remember reading something from an article or book about how we don't know how long our conversations will be. We don't even know the next word that will come out of our mouths, let alone predicting when a conversation will end.

In the same way, we expect to put a meeting for an arbitrary period of time (15m, 30m) and expect to have a productive conversation.

We assume that having a time bound conversation is logically productive. But, we don't know how long a conversation will take. We don't know how long it will take to solve a problem. We don't know how long it will take to make a decision.

### Meetings are structured periods for problem solving
The goal for meetings: they are structured in a way that we have an agenda, we have a time limit, and we have a goal. We have a facilitator, we have a note taker, and we have a decision maker.

It might seem like this is the most efficient way to solve problems, by time boxing. _However, perhaps we are losing out on the ability to solve problems in a more organic and dynamic way._

Let's say you are on a design team. You have to consider the fact that you may have an idea you want to throw out there at 11:05am, and then something to add around 2:35pm. By requiring a meeting to solve a problem, you sit there forcing you and others to come up with ideas on the spot. Ever notice that you tend to adapt and think of better ideas after the meeting is over?

It it the anti-zen way of approaching problems. See [this post]({% post_url 2024-03-03-on-ways-of-life %}) for more on this.

## The "gap"
There is a huge gap that is overlooked. There are the things that we say in our heads and the things we have an avenue to express.

For example, when it comes to communicating my comments on a GitHub pull request, I may _write_ in the comment box "Have you considered changing these lines to an abstracted class with a simpler API?."

If I had the avenue to be next to the creator of the PR, I might conversationally say: "Hey I notice these lines in your PR about audio playback and recording. So, you know that time when I sent that PR about the audio setup, I was thinking of constructing a new layer so that we can test it out. Also, we need to think how we can make this extensible for video as I was having a conversation with Paul about. What do you think?" On top of that, this would be a full voice conversation with my voice and tone (100x more understanding than a text thread). See [this post]({% post_url 2024-03-21-everything-is-made-by-people %}) for more on this.

The `gap` is something naturally human and opens up a channel for more nuanced conversations. We shouldn't give up the small nuances for the assumption that we are more efficient. The mis-communication is a small price that adds up to a larger problem: lack of deep understanding of others and loss of richer context.

I would liken this same gap to something like YouTube. It opened a new channel for creators to express themselves. It was a new medium that allowed for a new way of expression. If in the past we spent 2 hours watching TV, now we allocate half of that to YouTube.
