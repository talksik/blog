## Context

A month ago, as I was starting to feel paralyzed in my own hardware project (flowy), I considered pursuing a job that I remember dreaming about when I was a teen: working on space technology, and particularly working for SpaceX. It is a different league in terms of places to work for world class engineers.

I started reading physics book about Robert Feynman, looking at graduate programs to get experience with hardware and lower level programming, and considering other aerospace companies that would ultimately get me to SpaceX. Surprisingly, within a week of me applying to SpaceX as a shot in the dark, I got interest from two different teams.

I got through multiple rounds (primarily technical) and then I had the choice to either go with a `full stack engineer` role at Starlink, or a lower level `software engineer, components test` role for the Starshield (government program). I wanted to avoid building web apps at all costs, so I chose to do the final round with Starshield.


## The morning of interview
I slept 4 or so hours. My cycle was just off.

While I was driving early morning because of traffic, I remember telling myself: "If these guys don't take me, I will never take job ever again". It's just not worth being a cog in a machine. I saw all the people walking from the parking lot early at 9am. It was crazy how robotic everyone was and no one talking to each other; everyone looked the same as well.

## The aftermath
It was an insane day of interviews. However, I finished it and had a decent feeling considering that the hiring manager nearly begged for me to choose his team for the final round.

I got a rejection email the next day.

I was devastated for 12 hours, and then I started to see through my cognitive biases. I kept trying to figure out the reason why and what I could have done differently. This is a recipe for insanity:
- Maybe I didn't get enough REM or deep sleep.
- Maybe the white dudes didn't like me?
- I should have chosen Starlink because that role was right up my alley. They would have asked standard web questions.
- I thought they were willing to mentor me in my gaps?! Why'd they want to see me in the final round.
- One of the folks had a resume of mine that was 3 years old. Did the recruiter screw up?
- I should have studied x to nail that one question.
- Maybe they had another candidate who was more experienced and they didn't want to bet on someone for the long run. But that's short-sighted because I am more than just an engineer and I would have a much larger capacity to kill it for Starshield and SpaceX over 5-10 years. But then again, how would the interviewers all the way down in the food chain have that perspective?

However, I realized at the end of the day that the universe has its ways or maybe it's the 1000 little things that really put the universe in a certain formation to lead to a result. Maybe it was the recruiter not feeling well and not liking my glasses, or one small statement I made during the presentation.

**The point is you will never know.**

## Lesson Learned
It's important to remember that no one cares. Not the hiring manager, not the recruiter, not any of the interviewers. They are there and they will continue their work day after rejecting you.

Dwelling on outputs will drive you insane. Focus on the inputs. When you objectively look at inputs, you see that you could have taken x or y course.

Now, while I know the inputs that I could work on (interview prep, communication, operating systems course, algorithms course), I know that I am not meant to go down that rabbit hole.

I won't be the best in the world at that, even if I may be the top million. I don't want to be the best in the world at `Software Engineer, Components Test`. That's a game I don't want to play. Getting pulled into games like these is not fascinating to me. I have to take big swings, because money comes and goes, but time depletes.

I have NOT been doing: software engineering for enterprise companies, leetcode, courses on low level systems, etc. So I shouldn't expect much for these highly sought-after roles. I HAVE been doing: reading about startups, philosophy, worldview, digital communications. As crazy as it sounds, I have equivalent chances of doing other roles (business, product) or building a successful startup.

## Next steps
Focus on something that I can be the best in the world at. Work at it every day. Move methodically, think big. Think long term. That is rare in today's world. The principles and mental models I have learned throughout the years are my advantage.

Always remember the story of the WhatsApp founders: they were rejected for jobs at Facebook, so they built WhatsApp, and that cost Facebook $19 billion.
