title: "On standards of pain"

## Inspiration
I was listening to Joe Rogan conversing with some psychologist. She mentioned something about how gen Z are not go-getters. That they complain about every little cut, whereas the generations before would tell their kids to "brush it off" or "you'll live." I think this is so true and I have seen it. People like Justin and I have some sort of resilience that I don't see in others.

Millenials are go-getters and think they can do anything. They are part of the Mark Zuckerberg/social network era.

## Where is your bar?

Joe Rogan talked about how everyone has "the worst thing that has happened to them." If this is something really low, and they were able to get through it, they come out stronger throughout adulthood. On the other hand, if the worst thing that has happened to you is a breakup, then that is something everyone goes through vs. someone's parents being killed in an accident during childhood, or growing up in the slums of India.

Adversity is an advantage. I saw this concept when I was in my teens. I had/have some level of adversity:
- failures in startups
- failures with girls and relationships
- parents divorce
- seeing my dreams crushed in my cricket career
- incessant back pain from a bulging disc for the last 7 years.
- minor bullying during school
- strict parents who never cared about my wellbeing or dreams and brainwashed me to live a religious life growing up

However, looking back, it's not like I was in Afghanistan and my friends and family were blown up. It's not like I am dead broke in the streets of San Francisco. I had the opportunity to reach certain points in life to then "fail".

_The lower your bar, the stronger you are. If you come out of it, instead of settling in it like the weak, very few people can compete with you in life._

## Seeing things as they are
"When hungry eat, when tired sleep." We complicate things, as the zen folk would say.

Even when faced with difficulty, breathing and seeing things as they are without judgement is a profound experience. It is an acquired skill that doesn't take scripture or years of practice. As the Japanese would say, it could take one 30 years or 3 seconds to reach `satori`.

These days, we live so much in our heads and consume so much garbage (news, social media, friends, etc). Meanwhile, it is a nice clear skies and sunny outside, with the flowers blossoming.
