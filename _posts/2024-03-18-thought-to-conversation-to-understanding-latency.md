## Overview
In [this post]({% post_url 2024-03-01-thought-to-conversation-latency.md
 %}), we covered thought-to-conversation latency.

I left something very important out: **understanding**.

## Different mediums have different levels of effectiveness
A worthy measure of effectiveness is understanding. Whether it is understanding what your spouse is actually saying, or what your boss wants you to do, understanding is the target in most scenarios.

There are various mediums at hand which have different tradeoffs:
- phone calls omit visual information
- video calls are slower and people usually take turns talking for long period of time
- text seems efficient at a glance, but leads to wretched ambiguity (that is why email/Slack threads go on forever without resolution)
- on another dimension, natural language is a medium and has it's own efficiency (compared to something like hand signals)

_Fun observation: if you think about it, English and Chinese have different levels of efficiency. One character in Chinese could be a sentence in English. Chinese people talk swiftly as well, as to reduce their latency._

### Real life
Real life interactions allow people to sense every emotion and reaction real-time. There is a subtle outcome from this: we actually think less, and our `thoughts` freely flow out.

_The only latency is processing our ideas and translating them into natural language._

## Why this analysis is important
With the current growth in companies building human-computer brain interfaces, the goal becomes even more extreme. Perhaps take out the translation part to natural language. Rather, encode thoughts to bits and bytes and transmit to the intended person.

The general consensus is that natural language is pretty close to our thoughts. But is it really? I don't think so. I personally have a hard time getting my intuitive thoughts out in English. Likewise, while coding, getting my solutions into code requires translating to the rigidity of the system, framework, programming language, patterns, etc.

It is interesting to imagine a world where people have the least cognitive load possible. They are born into this world, and don't have to learn a language to communicate intricately.

### Note about understanding
The very subtleties in our speech make us unique. This is an exciting way of the world because you constantly process and try to understand the person speaking.

However, this also means that skillful communicators come out ahead. Why? because people understand them better.

### What should current solutions focus on?
While most solutions are adding emojis and features, I believe strongly that getting rid of the friction to a conversation in natural language will lead to more free-flowing conversation and ultimately increase understanding.

It sounds so simple in theory, but it's hard in practice to put into product form.
