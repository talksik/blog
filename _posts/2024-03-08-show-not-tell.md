title: "Show, not tell"

## Elon Musk
Musk talks about he had to change everyone's mind about electric vehicles. People thought:
- they were slow like gocarts
- range is limited
- were not sexy

He mentions the importance of building something people can see and touch ("a working prototype") in one of his speeches [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e7Qh-vwpYH8&ab_channel=USC). You have to get people to see what you see.

## Philosophy and world view
I have noticed that you can have all the theoreticals and data for why an idea will work and fit into the world. You can have a clear thesis and even a cultural storm as a catalyst for your idea. _However, it's not until you put something in someone's hand that they can touch and feel can your vision be seen._

I believe that humans have a natural sense of what is behind a product and brand. That is why you have to **show, not tell.** The nuances show from your product & brand. You can sense certain nuances from companies like Tesla, Notion, and Starbucks.

## New technologies
You will notice that the most transformative technologies and ideas don't have words. They can't because they are new paradigms in the world.

Think of smartphones before the commonplace word of smartphones. Notion's block model of information. These are examples of how some of the biggest ideas aren't in the dictionary yet so you really have to **show, not tell.**

## Lesson learned
Whether in product/service development, your output is an extension of you. People only understand that which is visible. They won't be able to listen to your deep psychological train of thought. That is why: **show, not tell.**


_Edit: I found a tangential idea from an article from the 2000s:_
