## Gary Vee's philosophy
I was watching a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=__RbyqxDDN8&ab_channel=GaryVee) of Gary Vee, and I think he brings up a good point: the number one reason why most people fail is not the lack of hard work, but **the lack of patience.**

He was someone who had a rough time in school, but he kept sacrificing leisure for work, and despite not being a tech entrepreneur, was still able to build an empire around his skills in marketing.

He preaches to people in their 20s to take the shot, don't take the job that makes your mom happy, and go for the thing that you want to be doing in life. Do it now, because you have much less baggage.

## Why is it hard to think about the long term?
When you hang around people who have fell into the trap of short term comfort and enjoying life, it because your default state to play the same game.

This is true for my friend groups who are in tech and chasing higher and higher total compensation. That's a game for those who want to play it, but I don't want to play that shallow game. I want to love the work I do. That's why it's best to hang around other risk-takers who are trying to build out their vision for the new world.

_Everyone is looking for quick wins._ They want to be an overnight success. The key is to love the game by getting small wins, and aiming for the 10, 20, 30 year vision.

The feeling of wanting to jump into a comfortable job, play the status game by buying that car or going to that concert is natural. It is marketed to us from all directions. We are so lost in the moment that we react to that instinct and get away from uncomfortable things without realizing that it's not the path to winning in the long run.

Another reason that it is so hard to stick it out is because **we want results yesterday.** This is short-sighted and 80-year-old you would never prioritize results in the short term.

## The greats put in 15,000 freethrows every day
Gary brings up a good point that if you put in 18 hours a day for a year and you are still bad at something, then maybe stop doing it. But that is very unlikely so stop complaining.

We have to change our standards of our work. There is a big difference between hours of work and actual effective output. The only way to make progress in building your own thing is by delivering effective value, unlike in a job where you are perceived as productive, but your work doesn't drive any impact. Build something big for value in the long run.

This brings us to the point of removing garbage and sacrifice; because you cannot deliver volume and quality without focus.

### Sacrifice
You have to say no to the distractions:
- Netflix
- friends wanting to go out
- hanging around other people who are not playing the same game as you
- buying clothes
- going to concerts
- youtube
- distracting music

This brings room for:
- coding/building more
- quality
- learning
- meditate
- read
- doing the boring work

## Example: Notion's journey
Notion's Ivan Zhao spent more than 7 years delivering his vision.

He is still crafting Notion's core product, and still sends product update emails to all users; without a single spelling mistake and with high quality visuals.

I have been an early adopter since 2020 or so, and I can sense the craft and persistence on their vision.

## Lessons learned
1. Take risks
2. Don't sign up for shit: dating/family, socializing, hobbies
3. Be patient: make clear bets, measure, evolve
4. Avoid conversing _too deeply_ with people playing other games

### My advantages
- I don't have a family. I can go balls deep.
- I have enough breadth to sit down and break down big problems.
- If I liquidate things, I can buy myself time; this would allow me to think a lot longer term and build for the next couple years.
