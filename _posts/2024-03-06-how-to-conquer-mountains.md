## Flash back
I remember when I was a kid playing cricket, I would get into flow state just focusing on my craft. I had no desire to get anywhere. I would bat many overs for my team because my role was to "put my head down and bat", suggesting to not think of much else.

In other words, "the score takes care of itself" as that one book discusses.

### Process

I remember _not taking shortcuts_, because the goal wasn't to get anywhere. In these moments, I was just trying to get that one nuanced skill down, and then seeing another area I can perfect. There was no `special sauce, strategy, tactics, or mindset`. It was sheer volume and focus on fundamentals. No wonder, people later saw me as someone with great technique in my batting.

I became one of the best youngsters in the nation when I was a teen without knowing it. Looking back, I found why I surpassed many others who had much more support/resources.

As I got better and better, I gained "word-of-mouth". I had no father or mentor helping me with my goals, but my name was spreading. I woke up one day and realized that I was the captain of the U19 national team on multiple tours.

### On working hard
I remember when I was playing, I was never forcing things ([see wu wei]({% post_url 2024-03-03-on-ways-of-life %})).

It was natural for me even though someone looking at me would think I was burning myself out. This brings another perspective on the general advice to work hard in business and life.

### What happened?
I also know what led to my failure later in my teens. Perhaps it was due to the environment at school, or otherwise, I learned to stop caring about the details. I lost 20% of the craft, because I was still scoring runs/doing well in games. I lost the intensity I had as a younger child. I started taking shortcuts.

I also gave up on my dreams of being a professional international cricketer. Why? Because I was around people who thought it was a joke of an idea. I didn't have support from mentors to take me to the next level, but that is not something I controlled, so I don't like to talk about it. But hey, maybe I did have control over that; I could have been resourceful and reached out to coaches internationally to help me. I should have convinced my parents that I wasn't a normal recreational player, and I needed help.

I also started having chronic back pain from wicket keeping; I could have curbed that as well, but my parents practically never took me to a doctor when I was young. I kept playing with it.

I started of thinking of college as inevitable, especially because I was around people in high school who had the prime goal of getting to the best college possible. Before I knew it, I played that game and got into UC Berkeley (the best public university in the world). And next thing you know, I have that as a backup leading to a marginal loss in the U19 cricket world cup qualifier in Toronto, and I headed to college and quit cricket after that point.

## So, how do you conquer mountains?
Here are some basic lessons I would tell my kids:
1. Don't take shortcuts.
2. Put your head down and do the basics. Again. Again. Again.

Forget the results and performances.

You don't need `special sauce, strategy, tactics, or mindset`. Not at your level. That's the last 1% of the job.
