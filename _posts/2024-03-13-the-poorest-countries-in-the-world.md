## Indoctrination? Brainwashed?
When someone is deeply immersed in a philosophy or religion to the point of being blinded by it, it can be likened to a form of indoctrination or brainwashing, although not necessarily as extreme. This process often involves techniques like isolation, control, uncertainty, repetition, and emotional manipulation.

In the context of religious schooling, some consider it a mild form of brainwashing where individuals are taught to accept certain beliefs without questioning them. _I remember growing up in such a community._

Disclaimer: this community was not illegaly manipulating people. It was implicit rather than deliberate. However, that is why the nuance this blog post will uncover are so interesting to me. It took me about a decade of skimming theology, testing different methodologies, listening to great thinkers, and cross-pollinating ideas to come to these on-going conclusions.

## Inconsistencies, and open questions
In the Iskcon community, if you grow up in it, you accept almost every sort of ideology that is given to you. The leaders (or "gurus") have impulsive, surface-level justifications to counter any contradictions or gaps. For instance, when asked about why so many people suffer, even if they are part of this community, they get the answer: "Krishna (their god) is testing you..."

Very few dig deeper. No one questions it. I remember it like it was yesterday, I always had an icky feeling if I was about to say something radical or question some concensus. This is true in any community; when we lived in tribes, being a radical would get us beheaded. In the European countries in the past centuries, when someone went against the church, they were charged with heresy, and dealt with violently.

Thus, our natural human instinct within a community is to protect the idealogies given to us.

## One clear prism: the most religous countries in the world
I searched and searched for answers to many of my questions. Concepts from Sam Harris, Alan Watts, even saints in India like Sadhguru, Jiddhu Krishnamurthy, Thich Nhat Hanh's ideas in Buddhism.

I have come to many worldviews that I will explain in posts in the future. However, I want to bring up one particular statement that Sam Ovens made in one of his videos. It has stuck to me for a long time. Sam is a clear thinker, practices meditation, and has very helpful frameworks to navigate and perform in the world. This statement made me re-consider the religious vs. stoic way of life.

Here is the statement in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LAPw2uSb28): "the **most religious countries** are some of the **poorest** in the world."

### What does it mean?
It's fascinating when looking at India. Despite their rapid growth, the quality of way in India is not particularly celebratory.

The statement uncovers a fascinating way of thinking:
- they don't learn from _the past_ because it was "karma"
- _the present_ is just fine because God puts us exactly where we need to be
- _the future_ is all up to the one and only, God

As I discussed, people will come up with varying "justifications" to circumstances of their people:
- Muslims: Allah is testing our faith
- Hindus: Bhagwan is mad at the people of India for breaking the rules of the scriptures. The scripture mentions this was to come in...
- Hindus: this age is known as Kali Yuga. Life is meant to degrade. (_a pathetic and pessimistic view of the world_)

_The list goes on, please let me know if you hear others._ Interesting thing is, if you are reading this, your first line of defence was either mentioned in my list, or it's very similar. Or you are now starting to see through the game.

## Conclusion
This analysis might sound derogatory and offensive; it has certainly shaken me to the core.

Please do not misunderstand my message as proving this is a wrong way of life. See my ideas on [ways of life]({% post_url 2024-03-03-on-ways-of-life %}) to understand the nuance.

I am merely suggesting that one should avoid being blinded by emotional and religious beliefs. Seeing things as they are allows you to see your inputs. When you know and control your inputs, you can more easily control your outcomes.

I'll leave you with a [great article](https://suryad.com/blog/high-agency/) I came across recently I came across recently on "agency" (or in my words, control). You can literally bend the planet, if your worldview allows it.
