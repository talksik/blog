It's not that you naturally aren't inclined towards **anime**, and other are. It's that you have not treaded a life in which the universe aligns to where you got hooked into **anime** the first couple times you tried watching it.

Thereafter, you didn't land upon the dopamine feedback loop to get your brain to get hooked on it. There is a dopamine feedback loop in everything: reading, movies, gaming, coding, being cashier at Trader Joes.
