## It's not words
Paradigm shifts are endless. We take them for granted, but when you first felt them, you knew it was something special. It's not words, it's a feeling. It's a feeling that you can't describe, but you know it's something that will change the world.

## It's not "businesses"
Paradigm shifts happen at all layers of abstractions in society.

## How are they created?
Who knows?

The universe telling the creator something subtle?

The creator's brain chemistry?

Cross-pollination of ideas from different fields? Perspective? _I think it's these two._

## Powerful insight
When you go back and figure out how things were before the life you live today, you come up with a "derivation" of _why_ creations happened.

They happen from ephiphanies of people saying: "what if...".
