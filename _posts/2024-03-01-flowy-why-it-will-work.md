## Vision
Our vision is a world where people do **not** need all the apps, tabs, threads, and notifications to get to one another.

`We are making digital communication more human.`

People shouldn't be breaking their necks to type all day on their phones or laptops.

### Personal anecdote
I hate my phone. I want to get away from screens. I hate all of the apps I have to manage to get to my people.

I hate threads going on in Slack that don't end up in resolution. I hate that I have to schedule or create a zoom link to get to my closest team members. I hate that I have to jump around 100 channels to catch up.

I hate when I am texting someone and they read the reply and I see the typing indicator. We are both there!

### Key Insight
_People are dying for less._

They are sick and tired of their iPhones and all of the apps.
They are sick and tired of all of the notifications.
They are sick and tired of all of the threads/conversations in all of the apps (work and personal life).

We believe less is more. Flowy is a natural, authentic way of getting to your people as if they are right there. We focus on reducing cognitive load.

## Why it won't work
There are always reasons why something won't work. However, the idea of this article portrays that the principles and vision behind flowy dominate any minor objections.

It is important to stick to our conviction even if every other person doesn't understand our product or mission.

There are certain objections that have "feature/product" resolutions:
- what if I don't want to hear someone (tune out or focus mode)
- what if I want to share stuff (flowy desktop sharing tray)
- it doesn't look sexy or minimal enough for me to carry around or put in my pocket (industrial + hardware design)

There are other objections that require philosophical resolutions:
- no one wants another device to charge
- how is this different than having an app on my iPhone
- but I need to put comments in a jira ticket to keep things organized (how does it take over Jira, Figma comments?)
- there is nothing new about this. not a new medium like vision pro.

_The list goes on._

## Conclusion
Do not overindex on feedback. We understand the foundational problems in society and our digital communication ecosystem.

Start a small revolution in a small area. Start with a working prototype.
