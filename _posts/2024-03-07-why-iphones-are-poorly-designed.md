title: "Why iPhones are poorly designed"
---

## Contrarian view
In this post, I will propose a thought experiment and try to keep it concise.

You see, smartphones and phones in general have the main goal of enabling `communication between humans`. Overtime, our devices have become utility devices, where `human to human commz` is last on the priority list.

### Breaking it down

Think about how many steps it will take for you to get to your friend/coworker "Jimmy" with your iPhone.

#### 1. Unlock your phone
Easy enough. Or is it a useless step?

#### 2. Which app will you use
Which app will you use? WhatsApp, iMessage, Phone (call), Facetime, Zoom?

Suppose you chose iMessage

#### 3. Find the person
Search for "Jimmy" in the search bar.

#### 4. Okay, how should I get to them?
I see:
- text box
- voice clip ("oh but then they have to play it back and what will they reply with?")
- call ("but what if they don't pick up or are busy?")
- facetime button on top right ("would I do facetime video? or facetime audio?")
- maybe ask them if they have time to chat? but then when would he be free? Calendly link?

You might even change apps entirely and use Slack. But then you realize that it's the same shit.

## Conclusion
The problem isn't you. It's **poor design:**
- decision fatigue
- context switching between different mediums
- high friction/sluggish

_Have we just learned to live with it?_ I think so. What do you think?

_Has no one thought of one succinct flow?_ That's what [flowy](https://flowy.live) is about. We are building a new protocol (sync + async) to make it feel like your people are right there.
