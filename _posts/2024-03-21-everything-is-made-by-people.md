### Steve Jobs quote
I can't put it better than how Jobs puts it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw&ab_channel=SiliconValleyHistoricalAssociation).

### Notion anecdote
It takes time, but with enough of a push, you can set a movement on fire.

They had a general direction of building tools to augment human capabilities. Almost like making the computer feel like an extension of you instead of another entity.

They mention this in a [chat here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMrjvxCIPpY&ab_channel=Notion). They call it `taste`.

They stuck to it, constantly improving their building skills to meet that `taste`.


## Why I feel so different than when I was a teen
There is a huge shift when you realize that everything is made by people. 

You *stop* seeing things happening to you. 

Especially as I was reaching my mid-twenties, I realized that I am part age group where a select few people need to be molding the new world that we want to see when we die.

You start to see the world as a playground, and you are the creator.

You don't just take things as they are. You have to look at things openly and see how you can make them better.

## Time
One of the strange feelings that changes is your sense of time. The short term becomes less important, and the long term becomes more important.

I see a huge disconnect between my friends and myself. I never ask my friends to venmo me back for a meal. Most of my friends are part of a conformist culture where they don't see what's important. Part of it is scarcity, part of it is not seeing the long term. 

They are focused on themselves and their immediate needs: get a job (whatever pays the most), get a house, get a car, get a family, save for that vacation. This is not wrong, but *we can't have too many of these people.*

They get involved in silly games like social media status or salary negotiation optimization or who discovers the news earliest.

The shift comes from realizing that if you are not going to (try to) build the new world, then who will? An 8 year old? An 80 year old?

## The decline of America
I see the decline of America as a result of this.

In a dopamine ingested world, less people will be willing to think for themselves. They will be distracted by gadgets, media, and unproductive ideas. Wisdom is also lost.

AI giving us more time to think is a double edged sword. I would bet that it compounds the number of people who sloth around.

## How each founder is different
Every company/product is an impersonation of the founder.

Amazon feels like Jeff Bezos if you hear him talk:
- long term thinking
- a focus on simple principles that don't change (customers want cheaper prices, faster delivery, and more selection)

Apple feels like Steve Jobs:
- a focus on taste/craft
- a focus on simplicity from his meditation practice
- a focus on the user experience from his calligraphy class
- an obsession about pushing the boundaries of design

Elon Musk feels like Elon Musk:
- a focus on the future of humanity
- the use of physics to build what he thinks would be cool for the world and himself

_Everyone brings a different flavor to the world._ This is why it is important to have a diverse set of founders building the future.

## What do you bring?
Doesn't mean you have to start a company. Maybe it's a blog like this, or the songs you write in your free time.

Maybe spend more time before choosing your next job. Focus on what matters: what will they allow you to build?
