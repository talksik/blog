## How philosophies are created
People of different eras come up with different philosophies for their way of life.

Most of them are based on that particular person's brain chemistry, genetics, experiences, childhood, environment, friends, etc. Everyone is unique in some manner, and has specific inclinations. This leads to a new philosophy being created every day.

## Hanging onto philosophies
**You will notice contradictions between philosophies.**

I have come to realize that if you live by a certain philosophy, you will likely change it when you come to a new environment or are challenged by a new thought experiment. This why I strongly believe in Jeff Bezos's view: "The point of life is to evolve."

Unveiling that even deeper, there is no right way to live. There is no right or wrong in this world, there is only what your existence in a specific moment tells you what is right or wrong. You are the perceiver of every experience. This is why some people will go out and see a drizzle and dance freely in the rain, while others dread it.

Thus, there is no point in hanging onto anything, whether it's a material possession, emotional feeling, or a belief system (such as a way of life). Keep `evolving`. That is the point. A species' ability to _adapt_ trumps any other factors when it comes to natural selection. There is no end evolution state, as the universe is constantly unfolding.

### Why does the idea of evolving work?
We are wired to evolve in the longer timeframe, and so living it daily is natural to us and fulfilling. Do not hang onto anything, otherwise you are slowing down your evolutionary process.

## You don't know the next moment
You are always in for a surprise as Jiddhu Krishmamurti outlines in his [book (Freedom from the Known)] (https://www.amazon.com/Freedom-Known-Jiddu-Krishnamurti/dp/0060648082). You don't know the next moment, and you don't know the last moment (your perception of the last moment is in the current moment, and always has a slightly different nuanced feeling).

By extension, you don't even know what your neuropathways will signal in the next moment and what beliefs you will have in the future. Sometimes we think we have a solid system until it is broken by some new experience. Thus, always consider that the universe and your experience of every moment is in flux.

## There is wisdom to consistency
A particular way of life will ultimately lead to a particular evolutionary state in the future. This means you must keep a couple things in mind:
1. there is a particular threshold of consistency you must pass to reap the benefits/reach milestones to that evolutionary state
2. if you try to mix 100 different ideologies, you may get nowhere
3. mental masterbation of studying philosophies should be considered pleasure, _not_ progress.

## My favorite - wu wei
The principle of `wu wei` is the art of sailing as opposed to the art of rowing. It suggests that you don't block yourself through frustration and forcing things. This does _not_ mean to live life like a leaf in the wind, as it is commonly explained.

In zen, they avoid scripture and words. Reality is not words. Thus, having a belief system is in itself creating a mask over the world. It omits the nuanced details if you were to see with a clear eyes without judgement.
