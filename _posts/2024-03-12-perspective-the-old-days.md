title: "Lack of perspective for young people"

## Latest observations
I noticed my dad and ThePrimeagen on Youtube  detailing how the job market was back in the 2000s and before. It seems as though America had a huge deficit of workers. The country was still in building mode, and you could apply to 3 jobs and get 2.

I was born in 1999, and I didn't get to see the world until college.

I also discovered yesterday the full evolution of digital communication: from big cell phones to Nextel walkie-talkies to carrier plans to text to 3G, 4G, 5G. I never really lived that era apart from having a Nokia phone and iPod touch growing up. Therefore, it's very fascinating to me knowing about the way of life before the oldest way of life that I have known.

However, I have lived through some transformations such as the introduction of touch screen interfaces. I also remember going on day-long shopping runs with mom, and today we buy everything with a click of a button from our couch.

## The startup vs. incumbents story
Naivety is a positive when it comes to building hard things. Experts deny new solutions. Thus, perhaps it is best that the new generation doesn't know what life was like before today.

At the same time, past solutions that revered or even those that died can provide valuable perspective. We know this from all of the startups from the dot com bubble in 2000/2001. People don't know this, but many of the internet companies that have blown up in the last 10 years were tried in the early 2000s.

Startups can capitalize on new technologies. That's why almost all big companies crumble in due course (think Walmart -> Amazon). It was a 25+ year journey but that's a blink of an eye in history; it even feels like it was overnight.

## Knowledge gaps of the newer generations
I have noticed that engineers from the 1990s and 2000s understand the deepest layers of abstraction much better than folks today. That is why you will rarely see someone my age (25) building hard/deep technologies. We build at the highest layer of abstractions. Why? Because we lack first principles. We didn't live through the advent of silicon valley.

## Conclusion
It's important to note that the last 20-30 years is nothing in the history of mankind. The technologies we see today are young, but young people are delusional because humans tend to have limited perspective based on their position. Learning from history can be a great advantage.

Human needs stay constant; new technologies enable what was done before to be done 10x better.
