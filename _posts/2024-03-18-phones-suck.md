## Anecdote
I was in the sauna today, and there were two teenage boys there. Both on their phones with their necks hunched down scrolling through tik-tok. No surprise.

A middle-aged, Asian man walked in. Watching a YouTube video. Of course, out loud.

Another man walked in. Asian. Slouched up on his phone.

**4/5 on their phones** (in the sauna). I couldn't take it anymore. I left. Of course this happens every time I go to the sauna at my local gym. Are we doomed?

## A quick trip through history
I remember being young and being able to sit with a sense of calm. Now, we have our phones in our pockets and that trickles anxiety into our veins minute by minute.

People used to sit in the sauna in peace. Maybe have a wholesome conversation.

Now, people are "busy". Almost like they are running a billion dollar company or something.

_The question is: are you making more money now while being 'busy' than you did in the 2000s?_ The answer is **no**. Inflation, job cuts, increasing prices. You're almost certainly not, so that tells you that your "smartphone" has given you nothing for the 10+ years of use, and it will give you nothing decades in the future. Why? Read on.

## Consumers vs. Creators
On your phone, you are a sucker. We are all suckers. There are `creators` and then there are `consumers`. Most people consume content and posessions 24/7, and we are selling our attention.

There are a few people who are building the new world. The `creators` feed off the suckers. I don't like to put it that way, but the truth is most people are going to continue feeding the winners more and more. This includes me. Why? I think lack of discipline. Everyone knows what they should be doing and what they shouldn't be.

_To all those who figured this out, you know the feeling of being sick and tired of consuming shit._
