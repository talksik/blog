# "How you do one thing is the way you do everything."

I remember hearing this from a [video from Sam Ovens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmFCs4ZFuOk&ab_channel=SamOvens).

The way your room and bed looks is how your brain looks.

How your garage looks is how your code looks.

How your closet looks is how your computer file system looks.

How your desk looks is how you gut health looks.

If you are used to multi-tasking and not focusing (you eat while watching TV), then you will do the same and jump tasks when you are at your desk trying to do focused work.

## Corollary - on finishing things
If you have a habit of not completely listening to a song, then you will never finish a project.

I have found this to be a common problem for myself and others around me. The root cause is not obvious, but this post suggests a likely victim.
