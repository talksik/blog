Deriving things is powerful.

You realize how things came about into the world. But most importantly, you realize that it was other humans who brought certain things into the world.

The interesting thing is that the world tends towards chaos. The world tends towards entropy. This means that we build on particular base foundations and twist and turn around that.

Coming from the train station, I saw that there were signs for station names. These were likely just different towns that the general public had consensus on. Then when the train was being built, they likely used these conventional area names already pre-defined. Or perhaps they consulted with the cities and used geographic regional codes and names that were already in the books to define the station names. The point is: train station names were built in connection to another dimension (city areas).

We often don't question these correlations and connections. They make sense for a long time, until something shifts. For instance, if after some chain of events, we stop naming cities and towns because there are way too many. So we may call the entire region of Northern California, and then each little area is depicted as 20 mile regions and we just number these. SF1, SF2, SF3. This is a different convention that perhaps becomes reality when we are multi-planetary species.

I heard Patrick at the Stripe conference talk about containerization and how it enabled global trade. It would not even be considered in the tech world. By him theorizing about these innovations, he is thinking in multiple dimensions. He also doesn't just look at big competitors. He will look at work tangential and learn from small companies and patterns in the world.
