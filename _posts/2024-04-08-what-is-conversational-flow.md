## What is flow state?
_Flow state_ is the feeling of getting "lost" in an activity. Time flies without you knowing it. Many describe it as a when you tackle a task that is just hard enough to be a challenge, but not too hard enough that you can melodically progress with hits of dopamine along the way.

## What is conversational flow
Trying to portray is harder than anything. It's like trying to describe the scent of a rose.
That is why the way of zen is without scripture because the world/reality is not words.

Here is an attempt: _conversational flow_ is the feeling of getting "lost" in conversation.

It is the natural instincts of human conversation when someone calls your name behind you or across the hall:
1. You turn your head over.
2. Get a shot of adrenaline who it must be.
3. Look at the person.
4. Get an association from the visual of the person.
5. Get a shot of adrenaline from wondering what they will say.
6. Attentively listening.
7. Processing & then replying when there is a gap in the conversation.
8. Repeating 6-7 until the conversation fades with an affirmative "closer" (to be covered in a future post).


### The rules of conversation
In the book [How We Talk - The Inner Workings of Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/How-We-Talk-Workings-Conversation/dp/0465059945), there is an interesting element that is studiedabout conversations as distinct from the formal English language.

That is that conversations have rules. We naturally have an average of 200-500ms gap between two people talking. Every question or statement is a request for a response, and we follow that rule 90% of the time. We innately predict when the other person is done talking. This is the beauty of conversations in real-life.

The question is, how can we model this _flow_ in the digital world? That's our goal with flowy.
