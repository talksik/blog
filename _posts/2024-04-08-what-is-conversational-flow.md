## What is flow state?
_Flow state_ is the feeling of getting "lost" in an activity. Time flies without you knowing it. Many describe it as a when you tackle a task that is just hard enough to be a challenge, but not too hard enough that you can melodically progress with hits of dopamine along the way.

## What is conversational flow
Trying to portray is harder than anything. It's like trying to describe the scent of a rose.
That is why the way of zen is without scripture because the world/reality is not words.

Here is an attempt: _conversational flow_ is the feeling of getting "lost" in conversation.

It is the natural instincts of human conversation when someone calls your name behind you or across the hall:
1. You turn your head over.
2. Get a shot of adrenaline who it must be.
3. Look at the person.
4. Get an association from the visual of the person.
5. Get a shot of adrenaline from wondering what they will say.
6. Attentively listening.
7. Processing & then replying when there is a gap in the conversation.
8. Repeating 6-7 until the conversation fades with an affirmative "closer" (to be covered in a future post).

You will notice that you do not control much of it. You don't know when you will slip into conversational flow. You don't even know what your responses will be because there is 0 latency and you make the conversation flow. Humans do not even predict how long a conversation will go on (see [Meetings are a construct]({% post_url 2024-03-30-meetings-are-a-construct.md %})).

Try it. You do not control much. It's quite beautiful when we slip into _conversational flow._


### The rules of conversation
In the book [How We Talk - The Inner Workings of Conversations](https://www.amazon.com/How-We-Talk-Workings-Conversation/dp/0465059945), there is an interesting element that is studiedabout conversations as distinct from the formal English language.

That is that conversations have rules. We naturally have an average of 200-500ms gap between two people talking. Every question or statement is a request for a response, and we follow that rule 90% of the time. We innately predict when the other person is done talking. This is the beauty of conversations in real-life.

The question is, how can we model this _flow_ in the digital world? That's our goal with flowy.
